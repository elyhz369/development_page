### Goal and Value of the Application
The goal of this app is to create an online store for my own art prints.

### Usability Principles Considered
Minimalistic
Cart total highlighted in black
Sort/filter put in a box to distinguish with other information
Item name & price stated again in case images fail to load

### Organization of Components
assets - artworkdata with info that will be passed on later
components - artitems
sort functions, filter functions, cart functions
aggregator component

### How Data is Passed Down Through Components
artitems mapped
price passed on to addToCart()

### How the User Triggers State Changes
activeStyleFilters
activeContentFilters
sortBy

ignore query, it was used in another way of coding before TA hours
